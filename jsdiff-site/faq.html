        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 10px;">
            To compare two JSON files:
        </p>
        <ol style="line-height: 1.8; padding-left: 30px; margin-top: 10px;">
            <li>Select 'JSON' mode from the options</li>

        <h2 class="section-subtitle">What is the Myers Difference Algorithm?</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 10px;">
            The Myers Difference Algorithm is an efficient O(ND) algorithm for computing the differences between two sequences. It's widely used in version control systems like Git and text editors. JSDiff uses this algorithm to provide accurate and fast comparisons. <a href="/docs/myers-diff-algorithm.html">Learn more about the algorithm</a>.

        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Can I use JSDiff offline?</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 10px;">
            Yes, once the page is loaded, JSDiff works entirely offline. All processing happens in your browser using JavaScript, so no internet connection is needed after the initial page load.

        <h2 class="section-subtitle">What's the difference between JSON mode and other modes?</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 10px;">
            JSON mode performs semantic comparison of JSON objects, ignoring property order. This means two JSON objects with the same properties in different orders will be considered identical. Other modes (Chars, Words, Lines) compare text as-is, character-by-character, word-by-word, or line-by-line respectively. JSON mode is best for comparing structured data, while other modes are better for plain text or code.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mb-large">
        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Can I export the diff results?</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 10px;">
            Currently, you can copy the results from the result panel. We're working on adding export functionality for various formats. For patch format, you can use the 'Patch' mode to generate unified diff patches that can be saved and applied later.
